                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then tip in the mince and break it up using a wooden spoon.<br>
                                Stir in the garlic and chilli, and cook for 10 mins until the mince is cooked through. Add the herbs and spices,<br>
                                and cook for a minute more.</li>
                                <li>Pour in the passata, the reserved liquid from the beans, the bouillon powder and peppers.<br>
                                Cover and cook for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened. Tip in the beans and cook for 3-5 mins more.</li>
                                <li>Meanwhile, prick two of the sweet potatoes all over using a fork, then microwave on high for 7-10 mins until tender.<br>
                                    Mash one of the avocados with half the lime juice in a small bowl.</li>
                                    <li>To serve, halve the potatoes and spoon over half the chilli, then finish with the mashed avocado. Chill the remainder for another day.<br>
