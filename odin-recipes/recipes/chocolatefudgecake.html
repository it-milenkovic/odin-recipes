                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins.<br>
                        Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.</li>
                        <li>Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil and milk.<br>
                            Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.</li>
                            <li>Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and firm to the touch.<br>
                                Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.</li>
                                <li>To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder,<br>
                                    then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.</li>
                                    <li>Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.</li>
